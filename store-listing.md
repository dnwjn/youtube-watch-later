## Description

Have you ever browsed YouTube and used that "Add to Watch Later" button? Me too.
Are you annoyed when you want to use that button, but it is not there? Me too!
Would you love to always have such a button, so you can instantly add videos to your Watch Later playlist? ME TOO!

YouTube Watch Later is a small extension that adds an "Add to Watch Later" button to videos on various pages, and in the notification drawer. Simply install the extension, configure it to your likings inside the popup, and go add those videos to your Watch Later playlist!

The following settings can be configured:

- "Mark notifications as read" allows for notifications to be marked as read when you add those videos to your Watch Later playlist.
- "Analytics" allows for successful button clicks to be sent to my personal analytics site. It is just a fun little gimmick for me to see if other people find it useful. Feel free to disable this though!
- "Logging" allows the plugin to send logs to your console. Could be useful for debugging purposes.
