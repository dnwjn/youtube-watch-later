Are you annoyed when you want to use that button, but it is not there? Me too!
Would you love to always have such a button, so you can instantly add videos to your Watch Later playlist? ME TOO!

The following general settings can be configured:

- "Mark notifications as read" allows for notifications to be marked as read when you add those videos to your Watch Later playlist.
